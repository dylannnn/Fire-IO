# Fire IO
Fire IO is a themeable real-time CMS that can be hosted in a static enviornment (such as GitHub pages). This means you can edit your website all within your GitHub page url (without pushing or manually editing files) for free (Unless you go over the free plan for Firebase). This is the current [milestone](https://github.com/Stackoverload/Fire-IO/milestones/v0.1%20release)

Oh and did I mention you can host it on a CDN? Yup. - [Example CDN using Firebase](https://fireio.firebaseapp.com/#/home)

Want a cleaner blog / site design? It's really simple to do. Simply open up the templates folder, 
and everything you need will be in there. The content of every page (Posts, Navigation, Comments,
etc.) are all inside the templates/directives folder. The outside of the content (for structing the
layout) is inside templates/content, and for the admin templates/admin.
